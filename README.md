# CinemaStream Streaming Web Application

CinemaStream is a Netflix-style streaming web application built as part of my growth as a Graduate Software Engineer. The project focuses on designing and implementing a modern, responsive frontend that consumes real-world APIs and delivers an engaging media-browsing experience.

This repository contains the frontend implementation, built using React, with a strong emphasis on clean UI architecture, component reusability, and real-world data integration.
